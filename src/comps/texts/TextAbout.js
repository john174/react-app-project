export const AboutMe = `Hello everyone!
My name is Evgeny, a student at Ariel University and a future software developer! Hope you enjoy my React project.`;

export const Explanation = "The choice of the movie theme for the React project is not accidental and reflects my long-standing passion for cinema. Movies have been an integral part of my life since childhood, and the variety of genres, the depth of the plots, and the talent of the actors have always inspired me. I believe that cinema is one of the most exciting and diverse forms of art, which can not only entertain, but also make us think, experience, and even change our perception of life. By creating a React project related to movies, I aspire to share my love for this art form, to provide other movie lovers with a platform for exchanging opinions and discoveries in the world of cinema. This project is an opportunity to combine my technical skills with personal interests and provide a valuable resource for all movie lovers.";
